    <h2>Bulk Email Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Delete hundreds of emails with a single click. If you choose to delete all emails from a sender, Clear My Spam will intelligently search for similar emails to delete.

    <h2>One-Click Unsubscribe</h2>
    <p>
      It's easier than ever to unsubscribe from unwanted newsletters or spam emails. Just click the "Unsubscribe" button in
      the sender drawer and we'll search for the link.

    <h2>Protect Important Emails</h2>
    <p>
      Got some important emails you don't want to accidentally delete? You can protect these emails so they won't ever
      be deleted (no matter how hard you try).
