Welcome to Clear My Spam!

Jonathan here, the founder and sole developer behind Clear My Spam. I wanted to share some essential features you can use to jump start your journey to inbox zero.

BULK EMAIL DELETION
------------------
Delete hundreds of emails with a single click. If you choose to delete all emails from a sender, Clear My Spam will intelligently search for similar emails to delete.

ONE-CLICK UNSUBSCRIBE
---------------------------
It's easier than ever to unsubscribe from unwanted newsletters or spam emails. Just click the "Unsubscribe" button in the sender drawer and we'll search for the link.

PROTECT IMPORTANT EMAILS
-----------------------
Got some important emails you don't want to accidentally delete? You can protect these emails so they won't ever be deleted (no matter how hard you try).

I hope you find these features helpful! If you have any questions, feedback, or feature requests, feel free to reply to this email.
