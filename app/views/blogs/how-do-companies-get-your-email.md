# **How Do Companies Get Your Email Address? ðŸ“¬**

##### February 28, 2024

###### Ever wonder why you get emails from companies you've never heard of? There are many sneaky techniques companies employ to gather emails for marketing purposes.

---

Is your inbox overwhelmed with marketing emails and spam? This is no accident -
companies and spammers use various tactics and pay good money to get their hands
on your email address. Understanding these methods can help you protect your
inbox and keep it clean of unwanted newsletters or spam. Here are 8 ways your
email address can end up in the hands of Taco Bell corporate (I'm fine with this
one, tbh).

#### Website Opt-Ins

Signing up for newsletters, creating accounts, or making
purchases on websites often involves providing your email address. Many
companies leverage these interactions to build their email lists for marketing
campaigns.

#### Data Brokers

These entities specialize in collecting and selling consumer
data, including email addresses (they kinda suck). Data brokers compile
information from a number of sources, including online transactions, social
media activity, and public records. This data is then packaged and sold
directly to businesses looking to expand their reach through email marketing.

#### Surveys and Contests

Have you ever participated in an online survey or
contest? These activities typically require you to provide an email address.
While this request may seem innocent, the provided email address could end up
on a marketing list.

#### Third-Party Apps and Services

Granting permissions to third-party apps or
services can inadvertently expose your email address. Some apps request access
to your contacts or address book, which they may use to build marketing
databases or sell to other companies. **Clear My Spam does NOT do this, and
will never sell your email address or data.**

#### Public Records and Directories

Your email address may be publicly
available through various public channels, including business directories,
social media profiles, or professional networking sites. Companies can easily
scrape this information to add to their email lists.

#### Events and Networking

Attending conferences, trade shows, or networking
events often requires an email address to register. The companies sponsoring
these events may collect attendee information for follow-up marketing efforts.
Understable, but still annoying at times.

#### Lead Generation Campaigns

Businesses often run targeted lead generation
campaigns to acquire potential customers' contact information. These campaigns
often offer incentives such as discounts or freebies in exchange for email
sign-ups.

#### Email Append Services

Some companies employ email append services to
supplement their existing contact or customer database. These services pair
email addresses with existing contact information such as names or phone
numbers.

A simple way to track which companies are selling your data is to add
`+COMPANY_NAME` to the end of your email alias during sign up or registration.
Gmail ignores everything after the `+` symbol when processing emails, so
`johnsmith@gmail.com` is treated the same as
`johnsmith+companynamehere@gmail.com`. If you're receiving marketing emails sent
to `youremail+tacobell@gmail.com`, you'll know who the culprit is. Some websites
won't allow you to include plus signs during registration, but many newsletter
sign ups or registration forms will!

Understanding these methods is an easy way to safeguard your inbox from unwanted
messages. But what can you do if you're already drowning in a sea of marketing
emails? [Clear My Spam](/) is here to help. Our app simplifies the process of
