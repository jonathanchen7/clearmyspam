Sorry for the jumpscare.

We‚Äôve all seen this dreaded storage warning. With enough persistence, Google is praying that you'll eventually whip out your wallet and commit to a Google One subscription that will last longer than your entire digital existence. **Not so fast!** With a few clever moves, you can stretch your free storage and delay upgrading for months (or even years).

Here's a quick summary:

| Method                          | Effectiveness | Speed / Effort |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Manage Google Photos**        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê           |
| **Google Drive Cleanup**        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê      | ‚≠ê‚≠ê           |
| **Deleting Gmail attachments**  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê      | ‚≠ê‚≠ê           |
| **Empty the Trash**             | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê       |
| **Clear Gmail clutter**         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê         |
| **Automate with Clear My Spam** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     |

#### 1. Manage Google Photos

If you‚Äôre anything like me, your photos are full of food photos or concert videos that I **promise** you will never watch again. Switch your backup setting from ‚ÄúOriginal Quality‚Äù to ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù and delete long videos. Important memories stay, file sizes shrink, and I would bet that you can't tell the difference between an "original quality" and "high quality" photo if you tried. Easy win.

#### 2. Clean Up Google Drive

Drive is sneaky. Mine had duplicate PDFs and an entire folder of blurry high school senior
photos. Delete what you don‚Äôt need, back up the good stuff on a physical drive, and keep
Drive lean. Your future self will thank you.

#### 3. Delete Large Gmail Attachments

Search Gmail for `has:attachment larger:10M` and you‚Äôll see some of the biggest culprits.  
Save anything important (tax documents, family photos) to your computer or external
drive, then bulk the rest!

#### 4. Empty the Trash

Fun fact: ‚Äúdeleting‚Äù something in Gmail or Drive doesn‚Äôt actually reduce your storage usage
until you empty the Trash. It‚Äôs like shoving clutter in a closet and pretending the house is clean.  
Empty the trash on Google Drive and in Gmail and watch your available storage bounce back.

#### 5. Clear Out Gmail Clutter

Although emails typically don't take up much storage, they can definitely build up over time (I'm looking at people with 100k unread emails). Bulk delete marketing/notification/spam emails and unsubscribe from anything you never read. It only takes a few seconds per sender and
feels surprisingly cathartic.

#### 6. Automate With Clear My Spam

And finally, the lazy option üòÖ ‚Äî let [Clear My Spam](https://www.clearmyspam.com)
do the Gmail filtering, unsubscribing, deletion, and cleanup for you. It's easy to use, incredibly effective, and costs way less than Google One over the long term.

I've been using Gmail + Google Drive for well over a decade and still have not given in to Google One. With a few
minutes of cleanup (or some automated help), you can reclaim your space and skip the monthly bill.

And if nothing else, you‚Äôll probably rediscover some weird old gems.

Happy decluttering ‚úåÔ∏è
